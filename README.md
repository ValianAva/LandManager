# LandManager
A portfolio project illustrating my skills -- a web application for land management project tracking
This project is similar to one that I worked on previously with a couple other developers.

Features:
* .NET | C# | TypeScript | React | Material UI | SQL
* Multiple separated web applications with a shared database and SSO
* Application Config stored in the database
* Project workflow based on user roles with a set heirarchy
